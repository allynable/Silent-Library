                        <p>
                            International Children's Book Day is a day dedicated to celebrating children's
                            literature.
                            It falls on April 2nd every year, and is a great opportunity to introduce children to
                            new
                            books, and to encourage a love of reading.
                            <br><br>
                            This year, the theme for International Children's Book Day is "READ the WORLD." The goal
                            is
                            to get children reading about people and cultures from all over the world. There are
                            some
                            great books out there that do just that, so make sure you take the time to celebrate
                            International Children's Book Day this year!

                            World Art Day is observed on April 15 each year. The purpose of this holiday is to bring
                            people together through art. World Art Day was first established in 2012 by the
                            International Association of Art and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
                            Organization (UNESCO). The purpose of this holiday is to bring people together around the
                            globe through art.
                            <br><br>
                            Art is a universal language, and it's easy to see why. It can be used as a way to express
                            yourself, your culture and heritage, or even just learn about other cultures.
                            <br><br>
                            The purpose of this day is to bring people together through art by celebrating its power. On
                            this day we encourage everyone who loves art (and even those who don't) to share their
                            passion with others around the globe through their own unique interpretation of what
                            constitutes “good” art!
